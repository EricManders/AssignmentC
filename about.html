				<h1>My music Taste</h1>
				<p>
					Something that I value alot in life is music. Whenever and wherever I am I always listen to music.
					<br>
					But my music taste lie somewhere different then most people do. My interests lay withing EDM/House/Pop and K-POP.
					<br>
					I got into K-POP during 2016-2017 where a friend introduced it to me and i instantly liked the vibe of it, altrough i dont understand a word of it, I do still like every aspect of it. The beats are amazing and the vocals are too. I really recommend listening to a few before giving a opinion!

				<h1>Gaming</h1>
				<p>
					Gaming has always been a big part of me. Ever since i got Pok√©mon yellow on the gameboy ive been in love with gaming ever since.
					<br>
					I own various consoles and try to complete every game i get (which is pretty hard sometimes).
					<br>
					I call myself an achievement hunter on the Xbox and Playstation, which means that i want to complete the game for 100% and unlock every achievement that has been tied to the game itself (a game could contain 1000 gamerscore more or less).
					<br>
					I currently have 106000 achievement points to my name. and 30 Platinum trophy's (Completed games)

				<h1>Adventures</h1>
				<p>
					During my life ive been on many adventures small and big.
					<br>
					Ive been on vacation in Italy for 7 years and loved being there at lake garda. It brought me many memories every year and the weather was amazing. One day i want to return there to see how it is like again.
					<br>
					I've also been on small adventures to Scheveningen and Den Bosch to visit the city and to stay overnight, amongst having fun with my girlfriend.
					<br>
					I was lucky enough to visit Disneyland Paris for two times, and when making this I'm planning on going for a third round!
